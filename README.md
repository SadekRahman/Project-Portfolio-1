A dog adoption website which partially runs on customer donations

Take a look here url:(#)

## Milestone Project 1 

### Purpose
This website was created for the purpose to complete the first Milestone project for Code Institute's Full Stack Develeoper course. 
Knowledge gained from the HTML and CSS modules was used to build this site.  
The website is aimed at users who are looking to adopt a dog and to choose from the dogs on offer. The secondary aim is for users to donate to the adoption agency. Focus is placed in keeping the website user-friendly, intuitive and appealing. Features, such as text in the first person (of the dogs) and images of dogs are used with the intention to win over the viewers' hearts. In turn this generates either a donation or contact to the company to express interest. 

## User Experience Design

## -Design-

All pages contain a drop-down menu at the top of the page included in the header. A donation button is also included in the header, making the donating process streamline for the visitor. This moves the hero imaged down and so is compatible for mobile phones. 

Color

- The color scheme is quite simple. The index page allows the hero-image to do all the talking. As we allow the picture to grab the attention of the viewer we keep a neutral background to encourage a change of emotion in the veiwer. 

- The "Donation" page is kept grey as this allows the viewer to remain calm and follow through with their decision. This lightgrey color is used throughout the website. 

Font 

- We use Amatic Sc with a fall back of sans-serif throughout the webiste to mantain a level of consistency and allows the viewer to familiarise themselves further.

### -Existing Features-

### Index/Home

#### Menu Button
Essentially acting like a Nav Bar. This button drop downs and allows the user to navigate to rest of the website from any page. No need to revert back to the previous page using the "back button".
It consists of two navigation links. One for Home and one for viewing the dogs avaialble. 

#### Donation Button
This allows the user to navigate to the the donation page regardless on which page they are on. 

#### Section 1 
This is a picture of a dog looking at a tennis ball. 
This sets the mood for the user and dog interaction, subconciously convincing the user that this is the correct life-decision for them. 

We also have cover-text over the hero image, again prompting the user further and taking them further along the,subconcious, road to adoption.

#### Section 2
This is to give the user some background knowledge on the company. As they become more familarised with the company they are more likely to use its service or donate in this instance. This section also offers the users reasons to choose Adopt A Dog instead of an alternative adoption agency. 

#### The Footer
This has links to social media through respective icons. These open on a new tab. 
We also have the contact details for the company which is accessible from any page. Having this information readily available allows the user to get in contact quickly and easily, without the need to search for contact details.

### Meet the Doggos (page)
This page allows the user to browse through the dogs that are currently avainlable. This page consists of a picture and a small paragraph written in the 1st person, from the dog's persepctive, and offers a description for the respective dog. 

### Donation (page)
This page allows the user to enter contact and bank details to submit a donation going towards the company. 

## Future Features

Add a page where you can get generic information on dog breeds
Add a where to find us page with map. Link this to existing map apps on phones.

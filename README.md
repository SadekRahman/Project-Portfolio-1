## Milestone Project 1 

### Purpose
This website was created for the purpose to complete the first Milestone project for Code Institute's Full Stack Develeoper course. 
Knowledge gained from the HTML and CSS modules was used to build this site.  
The website is aimed at users who are looking to adopt a dog and to choose from the dogs on offer. The secondary aim is for users to donate to the adoption agency. Focus is placed in keeping the website user-friendly, intuitive and appealing. Features, such as text in the first person (of the dogs) and images of dogs are used with the intention to win over the viewers' hearts. In turn this generates either a donation or contact to the company to express interest.

## -Design-

All pages contain a drop-down menu at the top of the page included in the header. A donation button is also included in the header, making the donating process streamline for the visitor. This moves the hero imaged down and so is compatible for mobile phones. 

Color

- The color scheme is quite simple. The index page allows the hero-image to do all the talking. As we allow the picture to grab the attention of the viewer we keep a neutral background to encourage a change of emotion in the veiwer. 

- The "Donation" page is kept grey as this allows the viewer to remain calm and follow through with their decision. This lightgrey color is used throughout the website. 

Font 

- We use Amatic Sc with a fall back of sans-serif throughout the webiste to mantain a level of consistency and allows the viewer to familiarise themselves further.

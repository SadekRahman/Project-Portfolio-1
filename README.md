## Milestone Project 1 

### Purpose
This webiste was created for the purpose to complete the first Milestone project for Code Institute's Full Stack Develeoper course. 
Knowledge gained from the HTML and CSS modules was used to build this site.  
The website is aimed at users who are looking to adopt a dog and to choose from the dogs on offer. The secondary aim is for users to donate to the adoption agency. Focus is placed in keeping the website user-friendly, intuitive and appealing. Features, such as text in the first person (of the dogs) and images of dogs are used with the intention to win over the viewers' hearts. In turn this generates either a donation or contact to the company to express interest.
